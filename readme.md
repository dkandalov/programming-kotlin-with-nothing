### FizzBuzz, Lambda Calculus-style in Kotlin

Inspired by [Samir Talwar's](https://twitter.com/SamirTalwar) 
excellent implementation of [FizzBuzz in Java](https://github.com/SamirTalwar/FizzBuzz)
inspired by [Tom Stuart's](https://twitter.com/tomstuart) excellent talk and blog post 
[Programming With Nothing](http://codon.com/programming-with-nothing).

To compile and run tests use Maven.

``ProgrammingWithNothing.kt`` contains implementation without types, i.e. using ``Any`` almost everywhere.
``ProgrammingWithNothingAndTypes.kt`` contains unfinished implementation with exact types.
The reason it's unfinished is that specifying types turned out to be not a straightforward task.

Note that this is purely experimental code.
All contributions are welcome.
